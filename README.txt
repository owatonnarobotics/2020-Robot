FRC Team 4624's 2020-Robot-Code
 All software for the Rebel Alliance's 2020 season and its game.

 2020-Robot
 The primary project for 2020: commanding Zion to play this year's game.
  Description
   4624's 2020 robot resides on a swerve drivetrain based on Team 2910's
    Swerve Drive Specialties MKII swerve modules. Controlling this is
    the first objective of the project, with movement and rotation in
    any direction and of any combination. Methods then exist for
    operating an indexer to store Power Cells, as well as a launcher
    for throwing them. Finally, this is all wrapped in a system of
    fully autonomous extension methods to complete tasks such as
    positioning, alignment, launching, and climbing either
    automatically or with autonomous driver assistance.
   Documentation
    The code in this project is fully documented, and a thorough
     description of each class and method exists at the beginning
     of its respective header file.
   Compiling/Usage
    This is a 2020 WPILib project which uses vendor libraries from
     REV and Kaui for motor controller and sensor functionality.
     With an up-to-date install of WPILib VSCode and these
     vendor libraries installed, the project can be imported
     and built automatically through GradleRIO. Otherwise, the
     code can be browsed on GitHub or locally.
